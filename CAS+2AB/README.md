In "CAS+2AB", the two files "CAS2AB+_ public_dist" and "CAS2AB+_sym_dist" correspond to the two versions "public_key" and "symmetrical_key", By using the ". exe" file and entering the corresponding input text file name, the first step of converting cas+ to AliceBob can be completed. There are two "flexbison" files, corresponding to asymmetric encryption and symmetric encryption versions. Through this step, the AliceBob description of some files can be obtained. Part of the text can be obtained by using the ". exe" file in "CAS+2AB_reprocess_dist" to obtain the final AliceBob output.

In addition to the above content, there are also some examples of cas+in the main folder, and "AB_latest_output" is the final output of these examples.

# AB2CAS+&CAS+2AB
This repository contains code and some input and output files for AB2CAS+ and CAS+2AB.

In "AB2CAS+", two "flexibison" files, corresponding to asymmetric encryption and symmetric encryption versions, are the first step in converting AliceBob to cas+. In the "AB2CAS+_dist" file, by using the ". exe" file and entering the corresponding input text file name, the output of cas+ can be obtained.

In "CAS+2AB", the two files "CAS2AB+_ public_dist" and "CAS2AB+_sym_dist" correspond to the two versions "public_key" and "symmetrical_key", By using the ". exe" file and entering the corresponding input text file name, the first step of converting cas+ to AliceBob can be completed. There are two "flexbison" files, corresponding to asymmetric encryption and symmetric encryption versions. Through this step, the AliceBob description of some files can be obtained. Part of the text can be obtained by using the ". exe" file in "CAS+2AB_reprocess_dist" to obtain the final AliceBob output.

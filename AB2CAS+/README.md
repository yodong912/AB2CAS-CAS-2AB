In "AB2CAS+", two "flexibison" files, corresponding to asymmetric encryption and symmetric encryption versions, are the first step in converting AliceBob to cas+. In the "AB2CAS+_dist" file, by using the ". exe" file and entering the corresponding input text file name, the output of cas+ can be obtained.

In addition to the above content, there are also some examples of AliceBob in the main folder. "flexbioson_output" is the output of these examples after the first step, and "output" is the final output of these examples.Specifically, when using two "flexibison" files, it is necessary to download the relevant plugins.
